This will be included in version 2.4 of LaBrea
so it is not necessary to add this patch if you
have a more up-to-date release.

Apply the patch-2.3.diff
to this version:
 * $RCSfile: labrea.c $
 * $Release: 1.0 $
 * $Revision: 2.3 $
 * $Date: 2001/11/20 17:10:19 $
 * $Author: tliston $

to enable the -O option. 
This option provides STDOUT logging with time tags
in seconds since the epoch rather the text. This 
option greatly reduces the overhead for both 
LaBrea and the perl Tarpit daemons because 
dates don't have to be converted from text
back to seconds repeatedly.

Everything will work without this patch, but
applying it will improve the machine utilization.
