	Changes to various test modules to accomodate perl
	'flock' implementations that use 'fcntl'

		Util/t/lockf.t
		Util/t/daemon2_cache.t
		DShield/t/move2_Q.t

1.07  Wed Sep 18 18:26:00 PDT 2002
	Correct documentation typo in Report/examples/localTrojans.pl

	Modified test procedure in t/append_open.t, hopefully to accomodate
	'flock' pecularities in solaris 2.8 sun4-solaris. These changes are
	UNTESTED, I don't have a sun box. There are no changes to the
	modules themselves.

1.06  Tue Aug 20 13:29:43 PDT 2002
	Update t/find_old_threads.t to allow tests to succeed
	in timezones other than US-Pacific.

1.05  Fri Aug 16 15:36:12 PDT 2002

	added "please wait" capability to "other sites"
	in Report/examples/paged_report.plx
	since there were no functional changes to the modules,
	no new release has been made. 

1.04  Wed Jul 31 17:07:11 PDT 2002
	added "please wait" message to Report/examples/paged_report.plx
	REMINDER, copy Report/examples/pwait01.gif to your images directory 

1.03 Wed Jun  5 10:41:36 PDT 2002
	Changes to Makefile.PL only. Some users have reported that on
	certain platforms, 'make' does not seem to like to build the README
	files but expects a target with a .c or .o extension. I've removed 
	the README builds and place them in a separate shell file which
	can be run manually. Similarly, the dependency check for Codes.pm
	is no longer in the Makefile, instead the build is done
	unconditionally each time Makefile.PL is executed. This might not
	be 'slick', but it does the job.

1.02 Tue May 21 20:51:10 PDT 2002
	fix 'timezone' so it works properly for end of year
	and all time zones

	add 'tz2_sec' so non integer hour tz's convert properly

	move Util::their_date to Tarpit.pm since it 
	needs to use tz2_sec only when Tarpit is loaded

  in Report v1.01
	update paged_report.plx and html_report.plx, removed some extra
	stuff, the pervious version from 1.00 will work fine.

	edit for move of 'their_date' from Util.pm to Tarpit.pm
	add a color to 'Trends' report and extend range to > 100,000
	move javascript precache standard list into Report.pm module
	add bonehead checking for images and image directory

  in Util v0.05
	move 'their_date' to Tarpit.pm

1.01 Mon May 20 22:30:52 PDT 2002
	corrected condition in Get/examples/web_scans.pl
	where sites.stats file could be improperly truncated

  IMPORTANT *** update your copy of web_scan.pl

	regex in daemon.pl caused some packed ipaddrs to be
	rejected as valid clients. change to '=='

	change daemon.pl logic to default to allow all
	client connections instead of allow none

1.00 Wed May 15 16:54:43 PDT 2002
	Updated 'daemon' to use sockets instead of FIFO
	to eliminate session overlap problems on busy server,
	this also facilitates remote daemon interrogation.

	THIS MEANS !!!

	you must update the following scripts:
		tell_me.pl
		html_report.xxx
		paged_report.xxx


	added module 'NetIO.pm'

	replace 'array2_tarpit' 'if' tree with recursive regenerator

  in Get.pm v0.04
	moved Socket function 'open_tcp'
	to LaBrea::Tarpit::NetIO

  in Report.pm v0.23
	add 'make_image_cache' to generate 
	javascript to force browser to precache the
	images for 'port_stats'

	update Report/examples/paged_report.plx 
	and Report/examples/html_report.plx to use image cache

  in Util.pm v0.04
	move 'reap_kids' to NetIO.pm,
	leave a pointer for backwards compatibility
	move 'reap_kids' to NetIO.pm
	rename 'cache_time' to 'daemon2_cache'
	  to more accurately reflect function

	move $time calculation in 'other_sites' into non error
	'if' statement to avoid spurious calls to 'Util::their_time'
