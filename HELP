Subject:          image path weirdness

   Hiya!  Have been fiddling with your perl stuff for watching LaBrea
servers.  Pretty slick.  The only weirdness I ran across was trying to
run it with the cgi scripts residing in a different directory than the
gif images.  My webserver is configured so that directories with CGI
scripts can't contain anything BUT cgi's and my non-cgi directories can't
contain anything executable.  Doh. 

   I found that paged_report.pl uses
the same variable to refer to where the gif images are, but one part of the
perl script needs the unix path to 'em, and another part of it needs the
URL path to 'em. This works dandy if they're both in the same spot and
you can just specify ./ but if they're in different locations, things
sorta break.

   I wound up specifying the URL path, (/LaBrea/ in my case) and then
made a link named /LaBrea that points to the real unix path where all the
gif files are.  (Yeah, I know, sortofa hack but I didn't wanna change my
webserver config)
