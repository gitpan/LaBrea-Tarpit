      );

      $text   = protocol(number);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is built by Makefile.PL from the text files in the IANA
    subdirectory (copied from the IANA web site).

    Do not edit the Codes.pm file, changes will be lost.

    $rv = protocol($x);
          Returns the upper case text name of a protocol
          number or the protocol number of a text name.

          i.e.  'TCP' = protocol(6);
                  6   = protocol('Tcp');
                  (not case sensitive)

          is not present in table

    $rv = icmp($x);
          Returns the upper case text name of an icmp

                   8   = icmp('EcHo');
                   (not case sensitive)

          return -1 or 'unknown' if lookup value 
          is not present in table

    $rv = numeric(scalar);
