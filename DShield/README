            'To'        => 'test@dshield.org',  # or report@dshield.org

            'UserID'    => '0',                 # DShield UserID
          };

        Called internally by all routines, it's error codes are returned by

    $rv = mail2_Q(\%config,\$message,[subject]);
          Queue a mail message as specified by 
          To, From, Reply-To, etc...

          subject is optional

          Must run 'process_Q' or 'deliver2_DShield'
          to actually mail the message

    $rv = move2_Q(\$config,$debug);
        Prepare the DShield file for mailing and rename as a Que's file in
        preparation for mailing.

        UserID, From, To, [Reply-To], and Subject are added to the file and
        it is renamed qF_unique_string.

          input:        \%config,$debug
          output:       false on success or no action
                        true = error message

          NOTE:         do not use debug mode with the mail 
                        address pointing to DShield, 
                        point it to yourself

          $debug = missing      normal operation
          $debug = 0            normal operation
          $debug = 1            do not delete cache file

          returns:      last error message
                        or false on success

                        address pointing to the real target, 
                        point it to yourself
